<h1>The Best Movies According To Gopal</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Black Panther</h3>

<p>
A significant amount of Black Panther's praise stems from its race- and gender-conscious casting and costuming.
It boasts the Marvel Cinematic Universe's first Black director, Ryan Coogler; an almost entirely Black lead cast; and a number of Black women in powerful and engaging roles.
</p>

<h3>2. American Sniper</h3>

<p>
It's a film about courage, love & patriotism. And Bradley Cooper shines as Kyle, giving an excellent performance overall.
'American Sniper' Synopsis: Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle's pinpoint accuracy saves countless lives on the battlefield and turns him into a legend.

<h3>3. The Guilty</h3>

<p>
Incredible acting by Jake Gyllenhaal with a script which held soo much raw emotion.
The movie has a very show not tell attitude and its left up to the viewer to piece together a cohesive picture of the story through the 911 calls.
At times it felt as though I was put in the seat of a dispatcher juggling the struggles of personal life with a high stress job.
